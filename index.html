				<h2>USACS is.. </h2>
				<p>USACS, also known as the Undergraduate Student Alliance of Computer Scientists is a Computer Science interest group. Primarily USACS exists as a club that strings together a series of events for the Rutgers CS community. Our "members" are loosely defined as event regulars attendees and participants.</p>
					
				<p>In addition to our two big events that we plan on a semesterly basis, USACS runs Code Red every Friday from 3pm to 5pm in Hill 252, a program set up for 111 and 112 students to come in and get free tutoring from USACS members. After Code Red at 6pm we hold a weekly Hacker Hour session. Each Hacker Hour an upper classmen teaches an awesome subject that CS students would normally never get to learn in the standard CS curriculum.</p>

				<p>USACS also manages a mentoring program that connects aspiring underclassmen CS students with experience upperclassmen who can teach them practical job-oriented CS skills. If you're interested in being mentored, come to Hacker hour and speak with one of the organizers about getting paired up!</p>
